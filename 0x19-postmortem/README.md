## The Drama Unfolds: üé≠
- **Duration:** April 3rd, 2024, 14:35 UTC to April 3rd, 2024, 16:50 UTC
- **Impact:** Inability to route traffic through the Load Balancer Apache.
- **Root Cause:** Misconfigured Apache load balancer was caught taking a nap, failing to route traffic effectively. Yes, it had one job!

## Timeline
- **14:35 UTC:** Monitoring alert screams "High Server Load!" like a toddler on a sugar rush.
- **14:40 UTC:** Me, being the Sherlock Holmes wannabe, started investigating the mystery.
- **15:00 UTC:** The first hunch - "Problem with the server!" Which clearly wasnt the problem.
- **15:30 UTC:** The plot thickens! Investigation reveals my Apache load balancer was daydreaming instead of doing its job.
- **15:45 UTC:** Incident escalates to the Infrastructure and Networking teams. Sirens blare!
- **16:50 UTC:** The resolution! Apache is jolted awake, reconfigured, and traffic flows smoothly once again.

## üîçRoot Cause and Resolution:
- **Root Cause:** My Apache load balancer was misconfigured, caught not doing its primary job - routing traffic. It was the digital equivalent of a bouncer not letting everyone in without checking the guest list.

- **Resolution:** Engineer me managed to reconfigure the sleepy Apache load balancer, optimizing server resources and jolting it back to work. Servers were also optimized to handle the increased load, restoring peace in the digital kingdom.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  1. Implement automated configuration checks for Apache load balancers - No more nap times!
  2. Enhance monitoring and alerting mechanisms - Early detection of any more sleepers.
  3. Develop a disaster recovery plan - Because even superheroes need a backup plan.
  
## Tasks to Address the Issue:
  1. Wake up and reconfigure the Apache load balancer.
  2. Add automated configuration checks for Apache load balancers.
  3. Optimize server resources and implement auto-scaling - Preparing for the next traffic jam.
  4. Review and update disaster recovery plan - Including superhero training for our engineers.
  5. Conduct a post-incident review - To find out why our load balancer was caught snoozing.

# üéâConclusion:
The outage on April 3rd, 2024, was a dramatic tale of a misconfigured Apache load balancer taking an unscheduled nap, causing chaos and slow response times for 85% of our users. Our heroic engineers swiftly reconfigured the sleepy load balancer and optimized server resources, restoring peace and smooth traffic flow in our digital kingdom. To prevent future dramas, we'll be implementing automated checks, enhancing monitoring, and ensuring our load balancers get their caffeine fix.
