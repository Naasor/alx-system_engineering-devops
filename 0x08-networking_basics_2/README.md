# 0x08. Networking basics #1

# Tasks

### 0-change_your_home_IP
* Write a Bash script that configures an Ubuntu server with the below requirements.
- localhost resolves to 127.0.0.2
- facebook.com resolves to 8.8.8.8.
- The checker is running on Docker, so make sure to read this

**If you’re running this script on a machine that you’ll continue to use, be sure to revert localhost to 127.0.0.1. Otherwise, a lot of things will stop working!**

### 1-show_attached_IPs
* Write a Bash script that displays all active IPv4 IPs on the machine it’s executed on.

Obviously, the IPs displayed may be different depending on which machine you are running the script on.


### 100-port_listening_on_localhost
* Write a Bash script that listens on port 98 on localhost.
