# SSH

In this project, I became familiar connecting to and working
with servers using the SSH protocol. I worked on a server
provided by Holberton School.

# Tasks 

* [0-use_a_private_key](./0-use_a_private_key): Bash script that uses `ssh` to connect to my server.

* [1-create_ssh_key_pair](./1-create_ssh_key_pair): Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.

* [2-ssh_config](./2-ssh_config): SSH configuration file configured to use the private key
`~/.ssh/school` and to refuse authentication using a password.
